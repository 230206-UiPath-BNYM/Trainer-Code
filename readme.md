Hello! I am Marielle Nolasco and this is my repository where I keep my demos for training. All demos are partitioned in folders pertaining to when they were discussed on a weekly basis. For example, week-1 folder would contain all the demos created in week 1 of training.

If you have any questions regarding the demos or documents in this repository, feel free to reach out to me @mariellenolasco or via email at marielletnolasco@gmail.com. Thanks for checking out my repository! Have a nice day!
